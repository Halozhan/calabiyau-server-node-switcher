# StrinovaNodeSwitcher

StrinovaNodeSwitcher is a project designed to automatically assist in monitoring and checking nodes across different regions of a game server, while helping to decide whether to use Tencent EdgeOne Accelerator.

This project provides an interface to automatically discover nodes and apply them to the `hosts` file.

**Note:** Editing the `hosts` file requires administrator-level permissions.
